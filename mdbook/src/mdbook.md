# mdbook publishing

[mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) is a static site generator that accepts markdown files. 

It's easy to use and flexible, including features like:

* separating [content from presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation)
* a single simple file for navigation


Besides Markdown/AsciiDoc differences:

* less version support out-of-box
* multi-component support requires configuration
* navigation file requires maintenance
