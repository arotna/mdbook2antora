= mdbook publishing

https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/[mdbook] is a static site generator that accepts markdown files.

It's easy to use and flexible, including features like:

* separating https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation[content from presentation]
* a single simple file for navigation

Besides Markdown/AsciiDoc differences:

* less version support out-of-box
* multi-component support requires configuration
* navigation file requires maintenance
